# Quiz-App
A quiz app built using flutter framework

The app Operates in the following way

1) The app starts with the flash screen

2) Then it proceeds to a page where the instructions of the app is displayed, On this page there is a button to proceed to the quiz

3) Then the next page allows users to start the quiz

4) The quiz starts on the next page and there are 10 questions to attempt (pre-defined length set up by me)

5) After the last question is attempted, the app proceeds to the result screen

6) The result screen shows the score, the questions that were correctly and incorrectly attempted.
